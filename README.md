The basic project structure has been set up.

* A `README.md` is in the root of the project and several project subfolders where needed.
* A `.gitignore` file and other common environment files are also situated in root.
* A pipeline `pl` folder is created in root. This is where all pipeline code will be stored. Note the structure of the pipeline folders. Each pipeline layers gets its own code folder to facilitate easily re-running subsets of pipeline code.
